  {
    question: "What is included in a standard home inspection?",
    answer:
      `<p>A standard home inspection is a non-invasive, visual evaluation of the property's major systems and components that are safely accessible. This typically includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Roof:</b> Condition of shingles, flashing, visible leaks, and drainage systems</li>
        <li><b>Exterior:</b> Siding, windows, doors, porches, patios, grading, and visible foundation</li>
        <li><b>Structure:</b> Visible framing, foundation, and signs of movement or settlement</li>
        <li><b>Plumbing:</b> Water supply lines, drains, water heater, and visible piping</li>
        <li><b>Electrical:</b> Main service panel, outlets, switches, fixtures, and visible wiring</li>
        <li><b>Heating & Cooling:</b> HVAC equipment condition and basic operation check</li>
        <li><b>Interior:</b> Walls, ceilings, floors, windows, doors, stairs, and attic access</li>
        <li><b>Insulation & Ventilation:</b> Where accessible (typically attic and crawlspace)</li>
        <li><b>Built-in Appliances:</b> Basic operation of appliances like oven, range, and dishwasher</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is a general overview—not a code inspection—and we don’t open up walls or move personal belongings.</p>`,
  },
  {
    question: "Are septic systems, pools, docks, lifts, and seawalls included in the inspection?",
    answer:
      `<p>Yes, these items are included in the standard inspection as visual-only evaluations of the accessible components. No invasive testing or disassembly is performed, and findings are limited to what is safely visible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Septic systems:</b> I inspect visible components like the tank lid (if accessible) and drain field area. No pumping or pressure testing is done.</li>
        <li><b>Pools and spas:</b> I assess the visible structure, surface condition, and accessible equipment for basic function and signs of wear or damage.</li>
        <li><b>Boat docks, lifts, and seawalls:</b> I evaluate above-water elements for visible deterioration or damage. Underwater components are not inspected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If anything appears damaged, I will recommend further evaluation by a qualified specialist.</p>`,
  },
  {
    question: "Are there different inspection packages, and what are the differences?",

      "<p>A 4-point inspection is not included in the Basic Inspection package, but it is included in our Standard and Premium packages.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a standalone 4-Point or Wind Mitigation inspection cost?",
    answer:
      "<p>A standalone 4-Point Inspection is $175, and a Wind Mitigation inspection is $125. If you bundle them together, the cost is $225.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for bundling services like mold or radon testing?",
    answer:
      "<p>Yes, these services are bundled at a discounted rate in our Premium Inspection package. You can also call us for a custom quote if you'd like to bundle specific services.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there extra charges for older or larger homes?",
    answer:
      "<p>There are no extra charges for older homes. For larger homes, we charge an additional $50 for every 500 sq ft over 2000 sq ft.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you inspect pools, docks, or seawalls? Is that an additional fee?",
    answer:
      "<p>Yes, we inspect them for no additional fee. It is a visual-only evaluation of accessible components. No invasive testing or disassembly is performed. If anything appears damaged or unsafe, I will recommend further evaluation by a qualified specialist.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I schedule an inspection?",
    answer:
      "<p>You can schedule by calling or texting us, sending an email, or using the scheduling form on our website.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical inspection take?",
    answer:
      "<p>A typical inspection takes about 2 to 3 hours to complete.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I be present during the inspection?",
    answer:
      "<p>You are welcome to be present if you'd like. It's not a problem, although some home builders may have their own rules regarding this.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas of the property do you inspect?",
    answer:
      "<p>We inspect all major areas of the home that are safely and readily accessible. This includes the roof, attic, exterior, foundation, interior rooms, plumbing, electrical, HVAC systems, insulation, ventilation, and built-in appliances. We also visually inspect pools, spas, septic systems, and docks if they are present and accessible.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you check for things like termites, mold, or asbestos?",
    answer:
      "<p>I check for visible signs of these issues. However, a standard home inspection is not a substitute for specialized testing. If I see signs of termites, I'll recommend a licensed pest control specialist. If I see signs of mold, I'll recommend air or surface sampling for confirmation. If I see materials that may contain asbestos, I'll note it, but only lab testing can confirm its presence.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of tools and technology do you use?",
    answer:
      "<p>I use modern tools like infrared cameras to detect moisture and energy loss, moisture meters, drones for inaccessible roofs, electrical testers, and gas detectors to ensure a thorough inspection.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "How soon will I receive the inspection report?",
    answer:
      "<p>You will receive the report by early the following morning. Same-day reports can be provided for urgent situations.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What will the report look like?",
    answer:
      "<p>You'll receive a clear, digital report with a summary of key issues, detailed findings with photos, recommendations, and a breakdown by system. It includes both a PDF and an interactive HTML version.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the report tell me if I should buy the house or not?",
    answer:
      "<p>No, the report provides an unbiased evaluation of the property's condition to help you make an informed decision, but it does not advise on whether to buy the house. It gives you the facts so you can decide.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if the inspection reveals significant problems?",
    answer:
      "<p>If major issues are found, the first step is to review the report and get repair estimates from licensed contractors. You can then negotiate with the seller for repairs or a price reduction. Your real estate agent can help guide you through this process.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you perform the repairs for the issues you find?",
    answer:
      "<p>No, I do not perform repairs. It would be a conflict of interest. My role is to provide an unbiased assessment. I recommend consulting with licensed specialists for any necessary repairs.</p>",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I call you after the inspection if I have questions about the report?",
    answer:
      "<p>Absolutely! I encourage you to call with any questions. I'm happy to clarify any part of the report and help you understand the findings.</p>",
